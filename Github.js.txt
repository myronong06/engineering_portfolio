      title: "6-Speed Sequential Gearbox CAD Model",
      image: "/images/gearbox.png",
      description:
        "This project was inspired by my internship at Xtrac, where I learnt transmission design principles. I modelled a 6-speed sequential gearbox in CAD, with the long-term goal of creating a fully functioning 3D-printed prototype.",
      process: [
        "Designed back-tapered dog teeth to ensure reliable dog clutch engagement",
        "Considered gear-change barrel geometry to control clutch movement",
        "Model prepared for assembly and prototyping"
      ]
    },
    {
      title: "Suspension Dynamics Investigation",
      image: "/images/suspension.png",
      description:
        "This project combined my interests in sim racing, vehicle dynamics and race car setup. I analysed damper behaviour in Assetto Corsa Competizione using MoTeC i2 telemetry. Dampers were chosen because their behaviour is independent of driver input.",
      process: [
        "Collected and analysed MoTeC i2 telemetry data",
        "Created suspension histograms to evaluate damping across multiple laps",
        "Compared damper performance with driving feel during data collection",
        "Researched how motorsport teams optimise suspension histograms"
      ]
    },
    {
      title: "Quarter-Car Suspension Simulation",
      image: "/images/quarter_car.png",
      description:
        "To further explore theoretical aspects of damping, I built a quarter-car model in MATLAB Simulink. This allowed visualisation of sprung mass displacements under different damping ratios and coefficients.",
      process: [
        "Simulated overdamped, underdamped and critically damped cases",
        "Visualised sprung mass displacement response",
        "Applied theoretical findings to real motorsport suspension tuning"
      ]

      title: "Xtrac: Kinematic Calculations and Control Systems",
      image: "/images/xtrac.png",
      description:
        "During my Xtrac internship, I carried out gearbox rig design improvements, combining kinematic calculations with control and electrical power system investigations to optimise accuracy and rig performance.",
      process: [
        "Performed kinematic equations for 2-axis gimbal motion",
        "Evaluated acceleration and torque requirements for rig operation",
        "Investigated pneumatic, hydraulic and electrical actuation systems",
        "Proposed an improved closed-loop control system",
        "Enhanced rig accuracy and reliability through system optimisation"
